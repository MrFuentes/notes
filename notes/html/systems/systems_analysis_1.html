<p>Feasibility assessment is an activity taht can take many forms, varying from an informal study carried out as part of strategy planning or project initiation, to a high level systems analysis “mini-project”, depending on the size or complexity of overall project.</p>
<p>The basic questions to be answered in any kind of feasibility study are: - Is there a computer solution to a given business problem? - Is the solution justifiable in business terms, bot organisationally or financially? For example: - will benfits outweigh costs - will the solution be politically acceptable - Can the solution be developed in time - Can the level of change associated with the system be absorbed at this time - are the skills in place and the people available to develope and manage the system - is the risk of project failure acceptable to the organisation</p>
