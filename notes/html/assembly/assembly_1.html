<p>1, 3, 4 ,6 to 24 (6 / (1 - (3 / 4))) describe the problem in terms that a computer can understand</p>

<p>drive from dublin airport to trinity college, describe the journey you would take</p>
<p>drive through santry, thorugh drumcondra, through O’connell street and over the bridge</p>
<p>Specification needs to take into account if something does not work</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>when you specify a problem, it’s up to you to communicate it to others</p></li>
<li><p>skill that is worthwhile developing and takes time to develope</p>
<ul>
<li>use pseudo-code to think about a problem when coming up with a solution
<ul>
<li>Pseudo code is language agnostic, meaning it can be applied to any language</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Arhcitecture, CPU and Memory are integral to low level computing</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>think abstractly about what the computer has to do, and describe it, then you can decide where/how it can be applied</p></li>

<p>Python software reads in the text file, translates it into it’s own internal code and runs it, but requires a Python interpreter to run</p>
<p>In C code, when you compile and link it, it is put through a process which produces a .bin file, which the machine itself can interpret</p>
<p>Compiling and linking makes a file which can run directly on the machine without using an interpreter, by</p>
